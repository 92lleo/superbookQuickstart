Sentio Superbook Quickstart Script

Disclaimer: I don't have anything to do with Sentio or the superbook (I only participated in the kickstarter campaign)
Use this at your own risk.

There are some tasks to do with your phone in order to use the superbook. These include:
- Install the sentio app
- Install the displaylink app
- Enable freeform windows (multiwindow)
- Enable dpi changing (for diffrent resolutions of phone/superbook)
- Enable onplus permanent otg

With this script you can do all those tasks at once.

Preparation & use:
- Enable developer mode: https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options
- Enable usb debugging there
- Connect your phone to your computer
- Drivers: Some phones (e.g. Samsung) are supported by windows and should be installed automatically. 
  For others: The script will install the Clockwork universial usb driver. If you still have problems,
  please visit: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb 
- just run the script and answer the [yes/no] promts
