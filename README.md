Sentio Superbook Quickstart Script

Disclaimer: I don't have anything to do with Sentio or the superbook (I only participated in the kickstarter campaign)
Use this at your own risk.

There are some tasks to do with your phone in order to use the superbook. These include:
- Install the sentio app
- Install the displaylink app
- Enable freeform windows (multiwindow)
- Enable dpi changing (for diffrent resolutions of phone/superbook)

With this script you can do all those tasks at once.

Preparation & use:
- Enable developer mode: https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options
- Enable usb debugging there
- Connect your phone to your computer
- Drivers: Some phones (e.g. Samsung) are supported by windows and should be installed automatically. 
  For others: This zip contains googles drivers, you can install them via the windows device manager
              or just visit this site and go from there: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb 
- When starting the script (superbookQuickstart.bat) your phone should show, otherwise check your device manager
  or google your phone model + "windows drivers"
- once your device is recognized, run "superbookQuickstart" and just follow the steps (make sure your device stays connected)
